Let the journey begin! üíª‚ú®



## **üìö Learning Path**  
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction to CLI**  
- What is a command-line interface?  
- Differences between **PowerShell** (Windows) and **Bash** (Linux/macOS).  
- Opening a terminal:  
  - Windows: `Win + X` ‚Üí PowerShell  
  - macOS/Linux: `Terminal` or `Ctrl+Alt+T`  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Basic Commands**  
| **Task**               | **PowerShell**         | **Bash**               |  
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|  
| List files             | `Get-ChildItem` (`gci`)| `ls`                   |  
| Change directory       | `Set-Location` (`cd`)  | `cd`                   |  
| Create a file          | `New-Item file.txt`    | `touch file.txt`       |  
| Read file content      | `Get-Content file.txt` | `cat file.txt`         |  
| Delete a file          | `Remove-Item file.txt` | `rm file.txt`          |  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ File System Navigation**  
- **Relative vs. absolute paths** (`./folder` vs. `/home/user/folder`).  
- **Wildcards**: `*` (e.g., `ls *.txt`).  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Scripting Basics**  
- **PowerShell**:  
  ```powershell
  # HelloWorld.ps1
  Write-Host "Hello, PowerShell!"
  ```
  Run with: `.\HelloWorld.ps1`.  

- **Bash**:  
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  echo "Hello, Bash!"
  ```
  Run with: `chmod +x script.sh && ./script.sh`.  

---

## **üîß Exercises**  
1. Navigate to a folder and list all `.txt` files.  
2. Create a script that greets the user by name.  
3. Pipe commands (e.g., `Get-Content log.txt | Select-String "error"`).  

---

## **üöÄ Next Steps**  
- Explore **environment variables** (`$env:PATH` / `echo $PATH`).  
- Learn **aliases** (`New-Alias` / `alias`).  
- Dive into **conditionals** and **loops**.
